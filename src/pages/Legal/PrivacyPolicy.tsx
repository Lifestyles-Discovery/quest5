              <p>
                We at Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest (LDI) recognize the importance of protecting
                the privacy of certain information ("Information") collected about our customers
                and prospective customers (collectively referred to as "Customers," "you" or "your").
                This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and
                how to correct or change it. At Lifestyles Discovery LLC, it is our intention to
                give you an understanding about how we collect your Information and the use we make
                of it in the course of our business.
              </p>

              <p>
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest gathers two types of information about Customers:
                data that Customers provide through optional, voluntary registration on our sites;
                and data LDI gathers through aggregated tracking, mainly by tallying page views
                throughout our sites. Such information enables us to tailor our content to fit our
                Customers' needs better and to help us understand our audience. However, be assured
                that Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest will not disclose personal Information
                to third parties without your consent, except as may be noted in this Privacy Policy
                or disclosed to you when the Information is submitted.
              </p>

              <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">How does LDI collect Information?</h2>

              <h3 className="mt-6 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">A. Optional Registration</h3>
              <p>
                Information is collected by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this
                occurs when you register at our site or request information or a service. Usually,
                the Lifestyles Discovery LLC sites and Lifestyles Discovery LLC service partners use
                your information to operate the sites and to deliver services.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mt-6 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">B. Usage Tracking</h3>

              <h4 className="mt-4 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses</h4>
              <p>
                What is an IP address? An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned
                to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so that your computer can
                be identified by the main computers, known as "Servers or Web Servers."
              </p>
              <p>
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest and/or its affiliates may collect IP addresses
                for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our
                advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When customers request pages from
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest and/or its affiliates' sites, our servers
                log the customers' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything
                personally identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but
                the Customer will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify
                a Customer when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our site terms
                of use or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mt-4 font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Use of Cookies</h4>
              <p>
                What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site sends
                to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file
                on your computer. Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences
                so that we can use the saved information to facilitate your use of our Web site
                when you return to the site. Cookies do not tell us your individual identity unless
                you have chosen to provide it to us. We never save passwords or credit card information
                in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you'll find
                that most major Web sites use them.
              </p>
              <p>
                By showing how and when Customers use a site, cookies help us see which areas are
                popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on
                such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is much
                easier to track with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services
                better tailored to our Customers' needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most cookies will expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your
                cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You
                can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being
                sent. However, note that some areas of our site and/or our affiliates' services
                may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For
                example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences,
                and/or may have difficulty completing marketing transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest and/or its affiliates have two primary uses
                for its cookies. First, we use them to specify a Customer's preferences. For example,
                Customers can specify keywords across several categories or markets so you don't
                have to tell us repeatedly what you want or need. Second, we use cookies to track
                Customers' Web site usage trends and patterns. This helps us understand our Customers'
                needs better and improve areas of Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest and/or
                its affiliates' services that our Customers find valuable. While both of these activities
                depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your
                browser preferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest
                and/or its affiliates do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies
                sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.
              </p>

              <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">With whom does Lifestyles Discovery LLC share my Information?</h2>
              <p>
                As a general rule, Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest will not disclose any
                specific personal information that you submit to us about you ("Personal Information")
                in a manner that connects you with the Personal Information, except when we have
                your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good
                faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following
                describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mt-6 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">A. Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</h3>
              <p>
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC may disclose some or all of your Personal Information to
                business partners or sponsors, but this use will be specifically described to you
                prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Many promotions offer
                opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more
                information, you give Lifestyles Discovery LLC permission to transfer your Personal
                Information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances,
                only your e-mail address will be shared. If more Personal Information will be shared
                with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mt-6 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">B. Third Party &amp; Aggregate Data</h3>
              <p>
                From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive materials or special
                offers from third parties. If you opt to receive information from these third parties,
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest will (with your permission) share your name
                and e-mail address with such third parties. Under confidentiality agreements, Lifestyles
                Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest may match Personal Information with third party data.
                Also, Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest may keep track of what portions of
                the Web site Customers are visiting and other Customer statistics, and aggregate
                this information to help us create a better experience for users of our Web site.
                This is all done without knowing your name or other Personal Information in order
                to describe our viewers and services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other
                third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mt-6 text-base font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">C. Other</h3>
              <p>
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest may also disclose account Information in
                special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this Information is
                necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
                violating Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest terms of service, or may be causing
                injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of
                Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest rights or property, other Lifestyles Discovery LLC /
                Lifestyles Quest Customers, or anyone else. Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest
                may disclose or access account Information when we believe in good faith that the
                law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary
                to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
              </p>

              <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">How can you control the usage of Information?</h2>
              <p>
                If a Customer wishes to update Personal Information herein for any reason, he/she
                may e-mail the requested change to: quest@luinc.com
              </p>

              <h2 className="mt-8 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What happens when you link to a third party site?</h2>
              <p>
                You should be aware that when you are on Lifestyles Discovery LLC / Lifestyles Quest
                and/or its affiliates' sites you could hyperlink or be directed to other sites that
                are beyond our control and/or outside our service. For example, if you "click" on
                a banner advertisement or through a search result, the "click" may transfer you
                off the LDI site. These other sites may include sites of advertisers, sponsors,
                pop-ups and/or partners. These other sites may send their own cookies to Customers,
                collect data, or solicit Information. This action is outside of our control.
